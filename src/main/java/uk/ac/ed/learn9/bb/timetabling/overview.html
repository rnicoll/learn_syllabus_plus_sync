<p>The Learn/Timetabling synchronisaton tool creates groups in Learn based on activities
present in timetabling, and then enrols students onto those groups based on students
on activities in timetabling.</p>

<p>The synchronisation process itself is managed through 
{@link uk.ac.ed.learn9.bb.timetabling.ScheduledJobManager}, which handles
scheduling of the process once the Spring context has loaded, and cancels
it when the Spring context is being shut down.</p>
